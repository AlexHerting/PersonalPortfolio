                <p>I'm a passionate software engineer graduating from Iowa State University in May 2025. Currently working as a Full-Stack Software Developer Intern at The Mutual Group, I'm always looking for new opportunities to push my limits, solve complex problems, and create meaningful software.</p>

                <p>What sets me apart isn't just my technical skills—it's my relentless drive. I thrive in team environments, where I can collaborate, innovate, and lead. I love taking on challenges that force me to think outside the box, and I’m not afraid to put in the extra hours to make sure a project is not just done, but done right.</p>

                <p>Beyond coding, I enjoy playing soccer, basketball, working out, doing puzzles, playing videogames and hanging out with my friends!</p>
